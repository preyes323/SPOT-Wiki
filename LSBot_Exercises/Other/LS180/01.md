## Problem 1: WHERE vs HAVING Clauses

**Conceptual**: Explain the difference between the `WHERE` clause and the `HAVING` clause in a SQL query. When should you use one over the other?

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

The `WHERE` clause filters rows **before** grouping and aggregation, while the `HAVING` clause filters groups **after** grouping and aggregation.

- Use `WHERE` to filter individual rows before they are grouped
- Use `HAVING` to filter groups after aggregation functions like `COUNT()`, `SUM()`, `AVG()`, etc.

**Example**: To find departments with more than 5 employees:
```sql
SELECT department_id, COUNT(*)
FROM employees
GROUP BY department_id
HAVING COUNT(*) > 5;
```
