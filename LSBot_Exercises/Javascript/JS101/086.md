## Problem 86: Function Scope Independence

What happens when we run this code? Why?

```js
function setStatus() {
  let status = '200 OK';
}

function printStatus() {
  console.log(status);
}

setStatus();
printStatus();
```

### Bonus Questions
1. What concept is being demonstrated by this snippet?
2. Is the second function considered an 'inner' scope, 'outer' scope, or something else relative to the first function?
3. How could we fix this example while maintaining our two separate functions?
4. What would change if we removed the `let` declaration inside `setStatus`?

<summary>Solution:</summary>

**Error:** `ReferenceError: status is not defined`

**Explanation:**

When `printStatus()` executes, it tries to access `status`, but there's no `status` variable in its scope. The `status` variable exists only within `setStatus`'s scope and is not accessible from `printStatus`. Each function has its own separate scope, and they don't share local variables.

Even though `setStatus()` was called first, the `status` variable was local to that function and was destroyed after the function finished executing.

**Bonus Questions:**

1. This demonstrates **function scope** and **scope independence**. Functions create their own scopes, and local variables in one function are not accessible to other functions, even if those functions are called one after another.

2. Neither. `printStatus` is not nested inside `setStatus`, so they're peer scopes (both at the same level relative to the global scope). They're not inner/outer to each other; they're independent parallel scopes.

```
Global Scope
├── setStatus (function scope)
│   └── status (local to setStatus)
└── printStatus (function scope)
    └── (no status variable)
```

3. Several ways to fix while maintaining two functions:

**Option 1: Use a global variable:**
```js
let status;  // Global variable

function setStatus() {
  status = '200 OK';  // No 'let', assigns to global
}

function printStatus() {
  console.log(status);
}

setStatus();
printStatus();  // "200 OK"
```

**Option 2: Return and pass the value:**
```js
function setStatus() {
  return '200 OK';
}

function printStatus(status) {
  console.log(status);
}

let status = setStatus();
printStatus(status);  // "200 OK"
```
