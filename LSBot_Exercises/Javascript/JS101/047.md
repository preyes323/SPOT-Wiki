## Problem 47: Ternary Operators

What's the difference between a regular operator and a **ternary** operator?

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

The ternary operator takes three operands, while regular operators typically take one (unary) or two (binary) operands.

**Examples:**

```js
// Unary operator (one operand)
!true

// Binary operator (two operands)
5 + 3
x === y

// Ternary operator (three operands)
condition ? valueIfTrue : valueIfFalse
age >= 18 ? 'Adult' : 'Minor'
```

The ternary operator (also called the conditional operator) is the only ternary operator in JavaScript. It consists of:
1. A condition to evaluate
2. A value to return if the condition is truthy
3. A value to return if the condition is falsy
