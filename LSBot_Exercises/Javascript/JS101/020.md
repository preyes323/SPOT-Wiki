## Problem 20: Multiple Variables Pointing to Same Object

Is it possible to have multiple variables pointing to the same object?

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

Yes, it is possible to have multiple variables pointing to the same object. When you assign an object to a variable, you're storing a reference to that object, not the object itself. Multiple variables can hold references to the same object:

```js
let arr1 = [1, 2, 3];
let arr2 = arr1;  // arr2 now points to the same array as arr1

arr2.push(4);
console.log(arr1);  // [1, 2, 3, 4]
console.log(arr2);  // [1, 2, 3, 4]
```

Both `arr1` and `arr2` reference the same array in memory, so mutating through either variable affects both.
