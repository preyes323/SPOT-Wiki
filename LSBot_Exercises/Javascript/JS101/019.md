## Problem 19: Reassignment

What does it mean to **reassign** a variable?

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

To **reassign** a variable means to give it a new value after it has already been declared (and possibly initialized). Reassignment uses the assignment operator `=` to update the variable to point to a new or different value. For example:

```js
let count = 5;   // declaration and initialization
count = 10;      // reassignment
```

Note that variables declared with `const` cannot be reassigned - they can only be initialized once.
