## Problem 39: Are Variables Expressions?

Is a variable an expression?

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

It depends. A variable declaration isn't an expression, but a variable referenced to retrieve its value is.

**Not an expression (statement):**
```js
let myVar;           // variable declaration
let x = 5;           // variable declaration with initialization
```

**Is an expression:**
```js
myVar                // variable reference
x + 10               // expression using a variable
console.log(myVar)   // function call with variable as argument
```

When a variable is referenced (used to retrieve its value), it's an expression because it evaluates to the value stored in that variable. But the act of declaring the variable is a statement.
