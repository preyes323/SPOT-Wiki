## Problem 91: Pass-by-Value and Mutation

Can a function that behaves as pass-by-value ever mutate its argument(s)?

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

No, by definition, since its argument must be immutable if it's pass-by-value.

Pass-by-value means the function receives a copy of the value, not a reference to the original. For this to be meaningful (i.e., for changes not to affect the original), the value must be immutable.

**Primitive values are immutable:**

```js
function modify(str) {
  str = str.toUpperCase();  // Creates new string, doesn't mutate
  return str;
}

let message = 'hello';
let result = modify(message);
console.log(message);  // 'hello' (unchanged - immutable)
console.log(result);   // 'HELLO' (new value)
```

Even operations that seem like they might mutate actually create new values:

```js
function modify(num) {
  num = num + 10;  // Creates new number
  return num;
}

let value = 5;
let result = modify(value);
console.log(value);   // 5 (unchanged)
console.log(result);  // 15 (new value)
```

</details>
