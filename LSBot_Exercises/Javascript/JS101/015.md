## Problem 15: Array Manipulation

I messed up my rainbow array. How can I replace `null` with the proper next color, 'green'? Try to come up with three distinct ways to fix the rainbow.

```js
let nextColor = 'green';
let rainbow = ['red', 'orange', 'yellow', null];

// ???

console.log(rainbow); // => ['red', 'orange', 'yellow', 'green']
```

### Bonus Questions
1. What if we didn't know how long the array was? Which of your solutions would still work, if any?
2. Did any of your solutions *mutate* the array? Which ones?
3. Could you use `==` to check your `rainbow` against the expected result? Why or why not?

<summary>Solution:</summary>

```js
rainbow[3] = nextColor;
// or
rainbow.pop();
rainbow.push(nextColor);
// or
rainbow.length = rainbow.length - 1;
rainbow.push(nextColor);
```

**Bonus Questions:**
1. Discuss the possibility of not knowing the position of `null` in the array. (`indexOf`)
2. All provided solutions mutate the array.
3. No. `==` checks for object identity.
