## Problem 90: Pass-by-Reference with Numbers

Can a function that receives a numeric argument ever exhibit pass-by-reference behavior? Why?

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

No. Numbers are primitive values in JavaScript, which means they're immutable and always passed by value. When you pass a number to a function, the function receives a copy of that value, not a reference to the original.

**Numbers are always pass-by-value:**

```js
function double(num) {
  num = num * 2;
  return num;
}

let value = 5;
let result = double(value);
console.log(value);   // 5 (unchanged)
console.log(result);  // 10 (new value)
```
