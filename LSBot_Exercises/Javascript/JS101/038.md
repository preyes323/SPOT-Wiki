## Problem 38: Is Everything an Expression?

Is everything in JavaScript an expression?

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

No. There are statements that don't evaluate to a value.

While most things you write in JavaScript are expressions, statements like variable declarations, loops, and control flow structures are not expressions because they don't evaluate to values:

```js
let x = 5;           // statement (variable declaration)
if (x > 0) { ... }   // statement (if statement)
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) { ... }  // statement (for loop)
return x;            // statement (return statement)
```

However, the parts within statements are often expressions:
```js
let x = 5;  // The declaration is a statement, but `5` is an expression
if (x > 0)  // The if is a statement, but `x > 0` is an expression
```
