## Problem 25: Operations on Immutable Types

If we can't mutate some data types, like numbers, then what happens when we call a method or perform some operation on them?

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

When you call a method or perform an operation on an immutable data type (like numbers, strings, booleans), the operation returns a new value rather than modifying the original:

```js
let str = "hello";
let upperStr = str.toUpperCase();

console.log(str);       // "hello" (unchanged)
console.log(upperStr);  // "HELLO" (new value)

let num = 5;
let result = num + 3;

console.log(num);       // 5 (unchanged)
console.log(result);    // 8 (new value)
```

All operations on primitive values evaluate to new values. The original primitive value remains unchanged because primitives are immutable. This is why we typically assign the result to a variable (either the same one through reassignment, or a new one).
