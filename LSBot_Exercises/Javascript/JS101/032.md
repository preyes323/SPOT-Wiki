## Problem 32: Truthy and Falsy Values

Is *every* value either truthy or falsy?

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

Yes, every value in JavaScript is either truthy or falsy. When a value is used in a boolean context (like in a conditional statement), JavaScript will coerce it to either `true` or `false`. There are no values that are neither truthy nor falsy.

However, it's important to note that not everything in JavaScript is a value - keywords, statements, and operators don't have truthiness because they aren't values that can be evaluated in a boolean context.
