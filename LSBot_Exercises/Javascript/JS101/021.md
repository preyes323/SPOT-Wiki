## Problem 21: Variables Referencing Variables

Can variables reference other variables?

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

No, variables cannot directly reference other variables. Variables can only reference values. When you assign one variable to another, you're copying the value (or in the case of objects, the reference to the object), not creating a link between the variables:

```js
let a = 5;
let b = a;  // b gets the value 5, not a reference to variable a

a = 10;
console.log(b);  // 5 (b is unchanged)
```

For objects, both variables will reference the same object, but they don't reference each other:

```js
let arr1 = [1, 2, 3];
let arr2 = arr1;  // arr2 references the same array, not the variable arr1

arr1 = [4, 5, 6];  // reassigning arr1
console.log(arr2);  // [1, 2, 3] (still references the original array)
```
