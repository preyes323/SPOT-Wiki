## Problem 48: Same Precedence Evaluation

How are operations evaluated when there are two operators **of the same precedence**?

<details>
<summary>Solution:</summary>

When two operators have the same precedence, they are evaluated based on their **associativity** - either left-to-right or right-to-left.

Most operators in JavaScript have left-to-right associativity:

```js
// Subtraction: left-to-right
10 - 5 - 2  // (10 - 5) - 2 = 3

// Addition: left-to-right
5 + 3 + 2   // (5 + 3) + 2 = 10

// Comparison: left-to-right
5 > 3 > 1   // (5 > 3) > 1 → true > 1 → 1 > 1 → false
```

Some operators have right-to-left associativity, like assignment and exponentiation:

```js
// Assignment: right-to-left
a = b = 5   // a = (b = 5)

// Exponentiation: right-to-left
2 ** 3 ** 2 // 2 ** (3 ** 2) = 2 ** 9 = 512
```
